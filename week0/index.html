            <p> The Netherlands (also known as Holland) is known everywhere as the land of windmills, canals, and
                tulips,
                and today's visitors certainly will find these among its many tourist attractions. But along with the
                breathtaking gardens and picturesque villages, they'll also find a vibrant capital filled with museums
                showcasing the country's rich heritage of artists (think Rembrandt and Van Gogh). There are medieval
                castles and cityscapes, a 13,800-acre national park, and a tide control system that's been named one of
                the
                Seven Wonders of the Modern World. All these attractions and things to do are within a relatively
                compact
                area, and the landscape is quite flat (the highest elevation is barely a thousand feet above sea
                level). So
                it's easy to do at least a little sightseeing the Dutch way: by bicycle. Many communities actively
                encourage the use of pedal-power and provide free bikes to explore the sights. However you choose to
                see
                the Netherlands, you're guaranteed a great time in one of the friendliest and most liberal cultures in
                Europe</p>

                id="photo1-attraction1" class="photo-right">
            <p> A picturesque cluster of canals over the Amstel River, in the province of North Holland, Amsterdam is
                the
                largest and most alluring city in the Netherlands. Vibrant, cosmopolitan, and steeped in culture, it
                greets
                visitors with fabulous museums, exciting nightlife, and a decidedly unique café scene.</p>

            <p>For a complete experience in the Dutch capital, don’t miss the illustrious <span class="highlight">Rijksmuseum</span>,
                <span class="highlight">Van Gogh Museum</span>, or <span class="highlight">Anne Frank House.</span>
                Also,
                make sure you fill out your itinerary with long strolls around Grachtengordel – the area in central
                Amsterdam where the city’s main canals, bridges, and the quaint 17th-century canal houses reside; and a
                foray into the controversial Red Light District – once famous for cannabis coffee shops and neon-lit
                brothel windows, now brimming with art studios and cool hipster hangouts.</p>

            <h2>The Hoge Veluwe National Park</h2>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/NL/netherlands-hoge-veluwe.jpg" alt=" Hoge Veluwe National Park"
                id="photo1-attraction2" class="photo-left">
            <p>Covering an area of 5,400 hectares in the province of Gelderland, Hoge Veluwe National Park is one of
                the
                largest and most varied nature reserves in the Netherlands. Home to interesting wildlife and
                geographical
                formations ranging from rolling sand dunes to dense woodlands, the park is a wonderful example of what
                can
                happen when sport, art, and culture meet unspoilt nature.</p>

            <p>Major attractions in the Hoge Veluwe National Park include the Kröller-Müller Museum, which is home to
                the
                world’s largest private Van Gogh collection; The Museonder (Underground Museum) – one of the finest
                sculpture gardens in Europe; and the stunning Jachthuis Sint Hubertus Hunting Lodge.</p>

            <p>To explore all these, take advantage of the 1,700 white bikes, free for everyone to use throughout the
                park.</p>

            <h2>Keukenhof Gardens</h2>
            <img src="https://www.saga.co.uk/contentlibrary/saga/publishing/verticals/travel/world-travel-events/keukenhof-gardens.jpg"
                alt="Keukenhof Gardens" id="photo1-attraction3" class="photo-right">

            <p>One of the country’s greatest attractions, the Keukenhof Gardens, often referred to as “The Garden of
                Europe“, is the second largest flower garden in the world after Dubai Miracle Garden, and a place
                anyone
                should visit while in the Netherlands. Located in the Bulb region, between Amsterdam and The Hague,
                Keukenhof, with its more than seven million bulbs planted each autumn, is a magnificent spectacle of
                colors
                and scents.</p>

            <p>In addition to admiring the gorgeous floral landscape, visitors can also enjoy various flower shows,
                markets, and parades held here throughout the year; take a memorable flight, bike tour, or boat trip
                around
                the bulb fields; or have lunch in one of the onsite restaurants.</p>

            <p>The best time of the year to visit the Keukenhof Gardens is during spring, when the fields are in full
                bloom
                and can be admired in their entire splendor.</p>

            <h2>Rotterdam</h2>

                alt="Rotterdam" id="photo1-attraction4" class="photo-left">

            <p>Amsterdam’s greatest rival, Rotterdam is the second largest city in the Netherlands and one of the
                world’s
                largest and busiest ports. Located in Western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, the city
                stands out for its gorgeous waterside setting, cutting-edge architecture, and high commercial
                importance.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, its lively nightlife, jam-packed cultural calendar, and yung university vibe make
                Rotterdam
                one of the most dynamic and livable cities in Europe.</p>

            <p>There are many sayings reflecting the perpetual rivalry between the Netherlands’ finest cities, but this
                is
                probably the most popular: “Amsterdam has it, but Rotterdam doesn’t need it”.</p>

            <h2>The Old Windmills of Kinderdijk</h2>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/NL/netherlands-kinderdijk.jpg" alt=" The Windmills of Kinderdijk"
                id="photo1-attraction5" class="photo-right">

            <p>There are many things that make the Netherlands the unique place that it is, but nothing complements
                better
                the traditional Dutch landscape than its picturesque windmills. The country is full of them, but the
                UNESCO-protected 19 old windmills of Kinderdijk are, no doubt, one of the most famous sights in the
                Netherlands.</p>

            <p>Designed in 1740 to drain the Alblasserwaard polders and to prevent flooding, the windmills were
                perfectly
                preserved ever since. Nowadays, tourists from all over the world come to admire this idiosyncratic
                scenery
                and learn about the brilliant Dutch water management. Moreover, from April to the end of October, one
                of
                these ancient generators is open to the public in order to be explored and admired.</p>

            <p>Kinderdijk sits in the province of South Holland, about 15 km east of Rotterdam, and can be easily
                reached
                by car, train, bus, and even by boat during the tourist season.</p>
