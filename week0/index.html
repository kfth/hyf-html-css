        <p> The Netherlands (also known as Holland) is known everywhere as the land of windmills, canals, and tulips,
            and today's visitors certainly will find these among its many tourist attractions. But along with the
            breathtaking gardens and picturesque villages, they'll also find a vibrant capital filled with museums
            showcasing the country's rich heritage of artists (think Rembrandt and Van Gogh). There are medieval
            castles and cityscapes, a 13,800-acre national park, and a tide control system that's been named one of the
            Seven Wonders of the Modern World. All these attractions and things to do are within a relatively compact
            area, and the landscape is quite flat (the highest elevation is barely a thousand feet above sea level). So
            it's easy to do at least a little sightseeing the Dutch way: by bicycle. Many communities actively
            encourage the use of pedal-power and provide free bikes to explore the sights. However you choose to see
            the Netherlands, you're guaranteed a great time in one of the friendliest and most liberal cultures in
            Europe</p>

            largest and most alluring city in the Netherlands. Vibrant, cosmopolitan, and steeped in culture, it greets
            visitors with fabulous museums, exciting nightlife, and a decidedly unique café scene.</p>

            id="photo1-attraction1" class="photo-left">
        <p>Covering an area of 5,400 hectares in the province of Gelderland, Hoge Veluwe National Park is one of the

            formations ranging from rolling sand dunes to dense woodlands, the park is a wonderful example of what can
            happen when sport, art, and culture meet unspoilt nature.</p>

        <p>Major attractions in the Hoge Veluwe National Park include the Kröller-Müller Museum, which is home to the
            world’s largest private Van Gogh collection; The Museonder (Underground Museum) – one of the finest
            sculpture gardens in Europe; and the stunning Jachthuis Sint Hubertus Hunting Lodge.</p>

        <p>To explore all these, take advantage of the 1,700 white bikes, free for everyone to use throughout the park.</p>

            alt="Keukenhof Gardens" id="photo1-attraction3" class="photo-right">

        <p>One of the country’s greatest attractions, the Keukenhof Gardens, often referred to as “The Garden of
            Europe“, is the second largest flower garden in the world after Dubai Miracle Garden, and a place anyone
            should visit while in the Netherlands. Located in the Bulb region, between Amsterdam and The Hague,
            Keukenhof, with its more than seven million bulbs planted each autumn, is a magnificent spectacle of colors
            and scents.</p>

        <p>In addition to admiring the gorgeous floral landscape, visitors can also enjoy various flower shows,
            markets, and parades held here throughout the year; take a memorable flight, bike tour, or boat trip around
            the bulb fields; or have lunch in one of the onsite restaurants.</p>

        <p>The best time of the year to visit the Keukenhof Gardens is during spring, when the fields are in full bloom
            and can be admired in their entire splendor.</p>

            alt="Rotterdam" id="photo1-attraction4" class="photo-left">

        <p>Amsterdam’s greatest rival, Rotterdam is the second largest city in the Netherlands and one of the world’s
            largest and busiest ports. Located in Western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, the city
            stands out for its gorgeous waterside setting, cutting-edge architecture, and high commercial importance.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, its lively nightlife, jam-packed cultural calendar, and yung university vibe make Rotterdam
            one of the most dynamic and livable cities in Europe.</p>

        <p>There are many sayings reflecting the perpetual rivalry between the Netherlands’ finest cities, but this is
            probably the most popular: “Amsterdam has it, but Rotterdam doesn’t need it”.</p>

        <h2>The Old Windmills of Kinderdijk</h2>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/NL/netherlands-kinderdijk.jpg" alt=" The Windmills of Kinderdijk"
            id="photo1-attraction5" class="photo-right">

        <p>There are many things that make the Netherlands the unique place that it is, but nothing complements better
            the traditional Dutch landscape than its picturesque windmills. The country is full of them, but the
            UNESCO-protected 19 old windmills of Kinderdijk are, no doubt, one of the most famous sights in the
            Netherlands.</p>

        <p>Designed in 1740 to drain the Alblasserwaard polders and to prevent flooding, the windmills were perfectly
            preserved ever since. Nowadays, tourists from all over the world come to admire this idiosyncratic scenery
            and learn about the brilliant Dutch water management. Moreover, from April to the end of October, one of
            these ancient generators is open to the public in order to be explored and admired.</p>

        <p>Kinderdijk sits in the province of South Holland, about 15 km east of Rotterdam, and can be easily reached
            by car, train, bus, and even by boat during the tourist season.</p>
